# [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/) plugin for Gnugat Wizard Bundle

Removes [muggle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muggle) steps from bundle
installation by shrinking it to a single command:

    composer require 'acme/demo-bunlde:*'

No more manual edition of `app/AppKernel.php`, everything is done automagically!
